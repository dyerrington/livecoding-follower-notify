#Follower Notification for Livecoding.tv
A channel follower notification utility I wrote for livecoding.tv.  It will pop open a notification on the configured streaming display and play a random sound from a list of sound files in a directory.

## Requirements

*  OSX (tested on Yosemite)
*  Growl ($3.99 @ Appstore)
*  Some sound clips
*  Feedparser (pip install feedparser)
*  Pandas (pip install pandas)


### Configuration
